ENA checklist to USI checklist converter

ENA uses checklists to represent data standards for samples.
The script in the directory converts them to USI checklists.

e.g. ./convert_to_usi.pl ERC000030 > ERC000030.usi.json

It will work for most cases, but does not handle every feature. It's your responsibility to make sure it works correctly.

You can find ENA checklists and their accessions here:
